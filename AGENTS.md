# Agent guide

This repository is the reviewed public projection of an internal monorepo, not an ordinary workspace. Every published file is listed in `release/public-source.json`, and upstream changes arrive through a three-way merge described in `docs/source-sync.md`. Moving or renaming files therefore has a cost that a normal repository does not have: it shows up as a conflict or an unreviewed new file at the next synchronization. Prefer changing content over changing layout.

## Layout

- `packages/` — first-party workspace packages. `packages/agent-modules/*` is a second level of packages, not a package itself.
- `third_party/` — vendored upstream packages (`pi-mono`, `sandbox-runtime`) with their own licenses. Their test suites are not part of this distribution's verification.
- `release/` — machine-read release contracts. `extraction.json` pins the source baseline and package scope, `public-source.json` is the file inventory, `dependency-licenses.json` records declared dependency licenses. Build, type-check, test resolution, and source checks all read from here.
- `docs/` — human-readable documentation and supporting media.
- `scripts/` — build and verification tooling. Shared constants live in `scripts/lib/`; import them instead of repeating literal paths or lists.
- `test/` — repository-level tests and `vitest-suites.json`, the declaration of every test file this distribution runs.

## Generated files

Do not edit these by hand; regenerate them and commit the result.

| File | Regenerate with | Checked by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `release/public-source.json` | `bun scripts/source-inventory.mjs --write` | `bun run check:source` |
| `tsconfig.standalone.json` (the `paths` block) | `bun run gen:tsconfig` | `bun run check:tsconfig` |

Review added, removed, and renamed files before regenerating the inventory: recording a file does not make it suitable for publication. Content-only edits to existing files do not require inventory regeneration. Keep private review material, verification reports, and temporary artifacts outside the repository; the inventory scans the working tree, including untracked files outside its explicit exclusions.

## Branches and source synchronization

Use a feature branch and submit a pull request; do not push directly to the default branch. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution and review requirements.

Name new branches by the purpose of the change: `feat/<short-description>` for features, `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes, and corresponding prefixes such as `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, or `chore/` for other work. Use concise English descriptions in lowercase kebab-case, for example `feat/provider-limits` or `fix/session-restore`. Do not use agent or tool names as branch prefixes, including `codex/`. Follow an explicitly requested branch name when one is provided.

Never merge internal Git history or cherry-pick internal commits into this repository. Follow `docs/source-sync.md`, keep unreviewed candidates outside the repository, and apply reviewed files individually. Advance `release/extraction.json`'s `sourceRevision` only after reviewing all differences for the selected source revision.

## Single sources of truth

| Concern | Declared in | Consumed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package scope | `release/extraction.json` (`packageRoots`) | build, type-check paths, source check, source sync |
| Package export → source file | each package's `exports` via `scripts/lib/package-exports.mjs` | `tsconfig.standalone.json` |
| Test files per gate | `test/vitest-suites.json` | `scripts/run-bun-tests.mjs`, `scripts/run-vitest-suite.mjs` |
| Retired source paths | `scripts/lib/retired-sources.mjs` | `check:source` (must not exist), `check:standalone` (must not be bundled) |
| Verification pipeline | `scripts/verify.mjs` | GitHub CI, `bun run verify` |
| Documentation-only classification | `scripts/ci-changes.mjs` | source verification, release audit |
| Source archive validation/extraction | `scripts/lib/source-archive.mjs` | source export, candidate validation |

## Common changes

Adding a workspace package: add it to the `workspaces` list in `package.json` and to `packageRoots` in `release/extraction.json`, then run `bun run gen:tsconfig` and `bun scripts/source-inventory.mjs --write`.

Changing package exports: run `bun run gen:tsconfig` after adding or changing an export subpath.

Adding a test file: add its path to the appropriate group in `test/vitest-suites.json`. Do not hard-code test file paths in `package.json` scripts. The suite files run under `bun test`; `test/bun-test-setup.ts` is the preload that registers the few matchers and helpers `bun:test` does not ship. Repository-level `node:test` suites remain in their existing gates; add workflow safety and release-tool regressions to `test/source-sync.test.mjs`.

Adding a verification gate: add a step to `scripts/verify.mjs`, with `platforms` when it cannot run everywhere. Do not add steps to the workflow file.

## Verification

`bun run verify` runs the same gates as CI in the same order; `bun run verify --list` shows which apply on the current platform. Run it before opening a pull request. Individual gates such as `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, and `bun run test:byok` remain available for iteration.

The full profile is the local default. `platform` omits only duplicate type checking. Use `bun run verify --profile docs` only when every changed path qualifies under `scripts/ci-changes.mjs`; it runs source inventory, generated-path, source-export, and release-tool checks. `AGENTS.md`, bundled runtime prompts, and `release/` changes do not qualify for that profile. `archive` skips Git export for source archives; the candidate workflow authenticates the archive before invoking it. Keep profile selection in the shared verifier.

Source export reads committed `HEAD` and rejects uncommitted tracked changes. During editing, run the relevant individual gates; run the complete applicable profile on the reviewed commit with a clean tracked working tree before opening a PR. Report the checks actually run and any blocked or untested boundaries. Offline tests do not establish live-service or cross-platform acceptance.

## Boundaries

Do not reference internal hosts, generated IDL, or private services; `check:source` catches known patterns but does not replace publication review. Do not restore paths listed in `scripts/lib/retired-sources.mjs` or remove supported capabilities to make standalone checks pass. Do not commit account data, sessions, logs, credentials, or real user content; use temporary data directories and synthetic test inputs. Documentation and commit messages are written in English; preserve the required languages of localized product strings and bundled runtime prompts. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
